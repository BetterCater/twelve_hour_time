# twelve\_hour\_time

Fork of the [12_hour_time gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/12_hour_time) on Rubygems. Fixes the `already initialized constant POSITION` warning.

# TODO

- Passing tests. Currently, they fail because the HTML selected attribute is out of order.
- Instead of monkeypatching, use railties to inject the helpers.
